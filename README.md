# ETF Analysis with Inferential Statistic and R

This project aims to answer some financial questions through the notions learned during the course "Probability and Statistics for Computer Science" at Politecnico di Milano.

This project received a grade of 4.5/5 by Professor Matteo Probo Siro Francesco Gregoratti.

## The problem
Francesco's financial portfolio has been built 10 years ago thanks to the advices given from his financial advisor through his bank. The financial advisor built him a portfolio by only using actively managed funds.

Recently Francesco, seen the recent results, had some questions, specifically he was thinking if it was a good idea not to use ETFs.
The questions he asks are:
- What are the annual costs of the ETFs? On what annual costs depend? How much would it cost yearly a 2B$ ETF with a difference of 0.05% between its performances and the benchmark?
- What is the medium yield of an ETF over 10 years?
- Do ETFs reach their goal? On avarage, is an ETF better than Francesco's portfolio?
- If Francesco was to buy an ETF randomly, what would be the difference between the ETF yield and its benchmark yearly?
- Francesco decides to create a portfolio with 40 random ETFs. What is the probabilty that at least 30 of them replicated the benchmark in the last 10 years?
- How did ETFs react to the most significative events of the last 10 years?

## Statistical Analysis

We answered all the questions mainly with:
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis test
- Linear regression
- Probability distributions
